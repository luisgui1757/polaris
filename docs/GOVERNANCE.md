# Repository Governance

Sentinel's checked-in policy and GitHub's effective policy must agree. A green
source-tree check is not proof of live enforcement, and a successful API write
is not proof of the resulting state.

## Canonical sources

- `.github/rulesets/main-integrity.json` owns unbypassable merge integrity.
- `.github/rulesets/main-review.json` owns review semantics.
- `.github/rulesets/main-owner-updates.json` prevents direct branch updates.
- `.github/settings.yml` owns non-branch repository settings only.
- `renovate.json` owns routine version updates; GitHub-native Dependabot owns
  vulnerability alerts and security updates.
- `.github/ci-requirements.in` owns direct Python CI-tool pins; its generated
  `.txt` lock pins the transitive graph and accepted SHA-256 artifact digests.
- `scripts/apply-repo-safeguards.sh` is the sole live apply path.

Classic branch protection must be absent. It is not a fallback: overlapping
branch mechanisms create two sources of truth, stale required contexts, and an
effective policy that neither checked-in source describes.

## Required live state

| Boundary | Required state |
| --- | --- |
| Integrity | PR, strict GitHub Actions `ci`, CodeQL errors and high-or-higher security alerts, linear history, no delete, no non-fast-forward; no bypass actors |
| Review | One code-owner approval, stale-review dismissal, last-push approval, resolved threads; owner bypass only in `pull_request` mode |
| Updates | Only the owner may bypass the update rule, and only in `pull_request` mode |
| Merge methods | Squash only; auto-merge disabled; merged branches deleted |
| Actions | Enabled; selected GitHub-owned Actions only; full commit SHA required; default token read-only and unable to approve reviews |
| Security | Secret scanning, push protection, Dependabot security updates, private vulnerability reporting, and weekly default-suite CodeQL for Actions enabled |
| Releases | Immutable future releases enabled |

The stable required status context is `ci`; its workflow aggregates every
blocking job. New blocking jobs join that aggregate instead of becoming another
ruleset context.

## Verification and cutover

Local source checks:

```bash
make gate
tools/ruleset-check
tools/repository-policy-check
```

Live changes occur only after the policy PR is merged. From a clean checkout of
`main` whose `HEAD` exactly equals GitHub's current `main`:

```bash
scripts/apply-repo-safeguards.sh --preflight-only luisgui1757/sentinel
scripts/apply-repo-safeguards.sh luisgui1757/sentinel
tools/ruleset-check --repo luisgui1757/sentinel --owner-id 139752288
```

Preflight proves repository identity, clean exact-main state, local policy,
successful exact-head CodeQL analysis, and non-duplicated live ruleset names.
Immediately before its first write, apply checks `main` again for concurrent
drift. It then applies every control and reads the effective state back through
GitHub's APIs.

## Recovery

Before writing, the apply script stores a mode-`0600` JSON snapshot under the
repository's git common directory. It includes the repository, Actions,
security, immutable-release, ruleset, and prior classic-protection state. A
failed apply automatically restores it. Retain the printed path until postflight
verification is complete; an explicit replay is:

```bash
scripts/apply-repo-safeguards.sh --restore /absolute/path/to/snapshot.json luisgui1757/sentinel
```

If rollback itself fails, stop all further mutations and use that exact command.
Do not improvise partial settings in the GitHub UI: restore the captured state,
re-establish a clean exact-main baseline, correct the source, and retry.
