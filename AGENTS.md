# Operating Contract

Baseline engineering rules for this project, loaded automatically. Treat them as
the floor, not the ceiling: the active task and this repository's own conventions
may tighten them freely, and may relax one only with an explicit, documented justification.

Precedence, highest first: runtime/platform safety; the active task; this
repository's conventions; the rules below; then personal global defaults.

## Modes

Mode controls authority. Tool or model name does not.

When the task does not name a mode, infer it from the request: inspecting,
planning, or reviewing is read-only (PLAN / REVIEW / REPORT-ONLY); implementing,
fixing, or building grants edit authority (FIX / WRITE) for that task's scope.
When unsure, prefer the least authority that still completes the task.

An explicit authority limit in the prompt is binding: if it says read-only,
review-only, no edits, or no tests, obey that literally even when a fix is
obvious. If finishing the work well would need authority the current mode does
not grant, stop and surface what you would do and why — do not silently exceed
the mode.

### PLAN

- Read, search, inspect, and reason.
- Do not create, edit, delete, format, migrate, commit, push, or start
  implementation work.
- Final output is a decision-complete plan.

### REVIEW

- Default read-only: read files and run non-mutating inspection commands.
- Lead with findings. Each finding includes severity, exact location, wrong
  behavior, proof or reproduction, source of truth, multi-location check,
  recommended fix, and confidence.
- Edit only when the task explicitly authorizes review artifacts.

### REPORT-ONLY

- Deliver the requested information with zero side effects; stricter than REVIEW.
- No edits, tests, generated artifacts, installer commands, or mutating scripts
  unless the prompt explicitly allows them.
- Return the requested report format exactly.

### FIX

- May edit files, add or update tests, and update documentation within task
  scope, then run the requested verification.

### WRITE

- Same authority as FIX, extended to larger feature delivery, generated
  artifacts, migrations, or packaging when explicitly requested.
- Protected files still require explicit task scope or user authorization.

## Review Protocol

Reviews are evidence-first. Apply this protocol whenever REVIEW mode is active,
including generated installs that inline the core contract.

### Before A Review

- Read the active repository entrypoint and repository overlay. If the repo uses
  a vendor or pointer setup instead of an inlined generated entrypoint, read the
  vendored core files named by its manifest.
- Read the requested review prompt and any local ledgers or rejected-finding
  lists.
- Re-validate prior open findings before hunting for new ones.

### Findings

Every finding should include:

- Severity.
- Exact location.
- Concise statement of wrong behavior.
- Reproduction, trace, or proof.
- Source of truth.
- Multi-location check.
- Recommended fix.
- Confidence.

Lead with material findings, ordered by severity. If there are no material
findings, say so directly and name any test or verification gaps that remain.

### Ledgers

- Preserve history. Append or change status with justification.
- Record false alarms in the rejected-finding location defined by the
  repository overlay.
- Accepted bugs need tests and documentation updates.

## Invariants

Durable engineering truths. These hold regardless of task, language, or phase.

### Correctness

- Before changing behavior, state in one sentence what you are changing and why.
- Trace every behavior change to a source of truth: a documented requirement, a
  failing regression test, a published specification, or an explicit user
  instruction.
- When you cannot produce a correct result, stop or raise — never emit a guess
  that downstream code will trust. A crash is recoverable; a silently wrong
  value is not.
- Never silence an error by catching and discarding it (empty catch, bare
  except, ignored rejection); handle it or let it propagate — a swallowed failure
  is the silently-wrong value above, one layer up.
- Satisfy a checker, never silence it: an inline suppression of a type, lint, or
  compiler diagnostic is a behavior change needing the same source-of-truth
  justification as any other, surfaced not buried, and legitimate only for a
  documented false positive.
- Handle empty, single-element, and boundary inputs, serialization boundaries,
  and numerical hazards before calling work complete.
- Before reporting a conclusion, check at least one plausible alternative
  explanation; state any uncertainty rather than implying false precision.
- Tie confidence to evidence; mark a fact you did not verify this session as
  unverified rather than asserting it.

### Architecture

- Prefer the repository's established patterns over new abstractions.
- Keep stable core logic independent of UI, transport, storage, and tool
  adapters; dependencies flow from outer mechanisms toward stable policy, not
  the reverse.
- Validate and bound external input at the system boundary; reject it there
  rather than deep inside.
- Do not silently change persisted data shape, external contracts, or workflow
  semantics.
- Treat secrets and private data as toxic: never commit, log, print, or echo
  them. Avoid hardcoded user-specific paths, names, or data patterns; model them
  as configuration.
- Add an abstraction only when it removes real, present duplication or matches
  an established local pattern.
- Weight caution by blast radius and reversibility: a local, easily reverted
  change needs less ceremony than a deletion, a migration, a persisted-shape
  change, or an outward-facing action.

## Execution

How to behave while doing the work — mode-independent reasoning discipline.

### Think Before Coding

- Do not silently pick one reading of an ambiguous request. State the assumption
  you are acting on in one sentence.
- When several reasonable interpretations exist, surface them and choose with
  the user instead of guessing.
- Push back when warranted: if a simpler approach exists, say so; if something is
  genuinely unclear, stop, name exactly what is confusing, and ask.
- Do not change or remove code or comments you do not understand well enough to
  explain.

### Communicate Precisely

- Answer the user's direct question first, then give the necessary context,
  action, or evidence.
- Be concise, direct, and precise. Separate verified facts from judgment,
  assumptions, and uncertainty; do not pad the answer with filler.

### No Unapproved Compromises

- Treat the delivery bar as the uncompromised ubiquitous canonical gold-standard
  for the task's real constraints. A change is not complete because it is
  convenient, green locally, easy to explain, or superficially acceptable; it is
  complete only when it preserves the system's intended semantics and is verified
  against the relevant source of truth.
- Do not ship workarounds, shortcuts, fake-green changes, test deletions,
  checker suppressions, hardcoded results, partial implementations, degraded
  fallbacks, or "good enough for now" fixes as finished work.
- If the uncompromised solution is blocked, stop and surface the blocker, the
  evidence, and the canonical path forward. Use a temporary compromise only when
  the user explicitly authorizes it, and document its limits and follow-up in the
  same change.

### Simplicity First

- Write the minimum that solves the actual problem. Nothing speculative.
- Add no capability beyond what was asked: no single-use abstraction, no
  unrequested configurability, no speculative handling for states that cannot
  occur (this is not license to skip validating real external input).
- If an implementation is far longer than the problem needs, rewrite it shorter.
  Sanity check: would a senior engineer call this overcomplicated?
- Do not cargo-cult patterns or add structure "for flexibility" you were not
  asked for.

### Surgical Changes

- Touch only what the task requires. Keep edits narrow and cohesive; every
  changed line should trace to the request.
- Do not "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting as a side effect of an
  unrelated change.
- Match the surrounding style even where personal taste differs.
- Clean up only your own mess: remove imports, names, and helpers your change
  made unused. Leave pre-existing dead code in place and mention it instead.

### Goal-Driven Execution

- Turn an imperative task into a verifiable goal before implementing. "Fix the
  bug" becomes "write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass."
- For multi-step work, state a short plan in which each step has an explicit
  verification check, then loop until the success criteria are actually met.
- Bound the loop: if two attempts at the same fix fail, stop and re-examine the
  diagnosis instead of trying more variations — repeated failure means the model
  of the problem is wrong, not that the next tweak will work.
- Stop at "verified," not at "looks done."
- Never present incomplete or stubbed work as finished: a TODO, a not-implemented
  path, a hardcoded canned value, or a disabled check must be surfaced, not handed
  off as done. "Simplicity first" means the simplest COMPLETE solution, not a stub.

### Calibrate To Stakes

- These cautious habits target non-trivial work. For a typo or an obvious
  one-liner, use judgment and do not over-ceremonialize.
- Calibrate by blast radius and reversibility, not apparent size: anything
  touching persisted shape, security, secrets, external contracts, or a migration
  is never "trivial" and keeps the full discipline.

## Workflow

The ordered procedure of making a change. References modes and testing rather
than restating them.

### Before Editing

- Confirm the active mode grants write authority.
- Identify the source of truth for the behavior you are changing.
- Inspect nearby code and documentation before choosing an implementation
  pattern.

### During Editing

- Prefer structured parsers and repository helpers over ad hoc text handling.
- Avoid dense one-line commands for non-trivial logic; use checked-in helpers or
  clear, reviewable scripts instead.
- Preserve user changes and unrelated worktree state; never overwrite, revert,
  reformat, or delete files the task did not ask you to touch.
- Do not hand-edit generated artifacts. Edit the source inputs, run the
  generator, and verify the generated output instead.
- Do not add dependencies, run installers, start services, perform migrations, or
  use networked tooling unless the task requires it and repository practice
  justifies it.

### Documentation

- Update the relevant Markdown in the same change whenever code, behavior, or
  architecture changes — roadmaps, status files, READMEs, and ledgers included.
- When a finding is rejected as a false alarm, record the reason where future
  reviewers will find it.

### Verification

- Run the repository's relevant focused checks after a narrow change; run the
  full gate when the repository requires it for non-trivial work.
- A check you did not run is not evidence. Report which checks ran and which were
  intentionally skipped.

### Git

- Use branches, pull requests, and required checks for non-trivial work when the
  repository defines that workflow; do not bypass hooks, checks, or review gates
  without explicit permission.
- Keep generated artifacts reproducible and fail loudly when they drift.
- Follow the repository's commit attribution and provenance policy; do not invent
  trailers without an explicit project or user requirement.
- Clean up temporary worktrees, branches, caches, and scratch files when done.

### Handoff

- Summarize what changed, why, and what verification proves.
- Call out residual risk plainly.

## Testing

The single source for test rules.

- Test behavior, not implementation details. One behavior per test, arranged as
  arrange / act / assert.
- For bug fixes, reproduce the failure through the highest-fidelity practical
  path first. Prefer the end-user or E2E workflow when available; when a narrower
  reproduction is the right proof, state why.
- Add a focused regression test for every fix, and a legacy-shape test for every
  persisted-data change.
- Mock only at system boundaries (network, filesystem, time, process); never mock
  internal functions to force a desired result.
- Never weaken, skip, comment out, or delete a test to make a suite pass; a red
  test is a finding, not an obstacle. Quarantine a genuinely flaky test only with
  explicit authorization and a tracked follow-up.
- Prefer deterministic, minimal fixtures.
- For numerical behavior, test shape, monotonic relationships, boundary cases,
  and tolerance-appropriate values.
- For persistence, test old shapes and missing new fields.
- For generated artifacts, test both the source metadata and the rendered output.
- If a bug pattern appears in one place, search for other instances before
  closing it.

## Memory

- Write durable memory only when authorized by the user or an active memory
  policy — not by default.
- Store stable decisions, invariants, and repeated failure modes, each with
  enough source and date context to later judge whether it has drifted.
- Do not store private data, secrets, raw transcripts, or local-only paths in a
  reusable rules repository.
- Keep updates append-only unless the user explicitly approves a correction.
- A recalled memory reflects what was true when written; before acting on one
  that names a file, flag, or value, confirm it still holds.
